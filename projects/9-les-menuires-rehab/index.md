excerpt: "The project for the Les Menuires Rehab competition aims to bring a new image to the commercial and hotel complex of Les Menuires, and at the same time increase its density. The concept of the intervention is the improvement and rehabilitation of the building without invading the surrounding space, to leave the wide square intact."
body: "The project for the Les Menuires Rehab competition aims to bring a new image to the commercial and hotel complex of Les Menuires, and at the same time increase its density. The concept of the intervention is the improvement and rehabilitation of the building without invading the surrounding space, to leave the wide square, and above all the incredible natural landscape, intact. The project is integrated into the existing commercial base, improving its narrow corridor with more extensive spaces at the entrances and more connections with the outside. Two isolated vertical nuclei are those that connect directly with the new commercial area located on the rooftops, which allows, through walkways that float in the air, to pass from one space to another."
