excerpt: "This project consists of a change of use from single-family house to an apartment block, with an average of 70 m² per flat, and commercial premises on the ground floor. The main feature of the original building is its contiguity with the ancient walls of the village of Hostalric, which is in fact one of the façades of the building."
body: "This project consists of a change of use from single-family house to an apartment block, with an average of 70 m² per flat, and commercial premises on the ground floor. The main feature of the original building is its contiguity with the ancient walls of the village of Hostalric, which is in fact one of the façades of the building. The house was the result of the union between two different buildings, from different construction age and with different systems. The biggest challenge of the project has been to divide the space into six apartments, maintaining optimal living and light conditions and respecting the preexistence."
