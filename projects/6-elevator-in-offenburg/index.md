excerpt: "The elevator is understood as an element in contact with the city walls, as another layer in its history. For this reason, the elevator box maintains a formal relationship with the buttresses and with the towers, as elements attached to the wall."
body: "The proposal is based on a study of the site, valuing the current mobility and future urban dynamics that will occur on the left bank of the canal. For this reason, the proposed location of the elevator is between the two existing stairs that now connect the two levels of the city. Besides, the arrival in Vinzentiusgarten allows to improve it as a public space, in addition to be directly connected to the center of the city and so guaranteeing accessibility. The elevator is understood as an element in contact with the city walls, as another layer in its history. For this reason, the elevator box maintains a formal relationship with the buttresses and with the towers, as elements attached to the wall. On its sides it has a double sheet of bricks with flamenco bonding, that allows to obtain some transverse points of light. The frontal fa√ßade is formed by a latticework of bricks that allow filtered vision throughout the vertical path."
