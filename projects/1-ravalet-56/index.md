body: "The project consists on the rehabilitation of a carpentry warehouse and its conversion into a single-family home. The building rises up in an area of the village of Hostalric (Ravalet) next to the Tordera river, characterized by a strong topography. The house develops in two floors, with access from Carrer de Ravalet through a “transparent” area that surrounds a patio, that retraces the lines of an existing patio. The ground floor, on the other hand, opens towards the private rear garden."
