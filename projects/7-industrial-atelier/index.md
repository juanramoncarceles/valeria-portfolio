body: "The project consists on the reconversion of an industrial building into a flexible work and living space. The proposal is based on dividing the space into 5 independent areas to turn them into productive workshops for flexible use, each of them equipped with its own kitchenette and bathroom services. The main feature of the workshops is the possibility of converting the space from fully open to compartmentalized areas, to allow coexistence between different activities. Another peculiar element of the project is the backyard, which allows crossed ventilation for better climate comfort and a very intimate private semi-outdoor area. The materials of the new construction, which are limited to wood and ceramic walls, look for a matching with the industrial aspect of the ship."
