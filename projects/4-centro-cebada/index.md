excerpt: 'The Mercado de la Cebada is a food market located in the center of Madrid. It is still in use, but undervalued and rapidly deteriorating. Next to it is the Campo de la Cebada, a "void" left by the demolition of the La Latina Sports Center, which the neighbors have sized as a space for events.'
body: 'The Mercado de la Cebada is a food market located in the center of Madrid. It is still in use, but undervalued and rapidly deteriorating. Next to it is the Campo de la Cebada, a "void" left by the demolition of the La Latina Sports Center, which the neighbors have sized as a space for events. Madrid City Council approved in 2007 a project that foresaw the demolition of the market, but it has never been carried out because of the numerous popular protests. Centro Cebada project is an alternative that attempts to respond to the needs of the neighbors and propose a new mixed use, taking advantage of the structure of the building and preserving the market function of supplies.'
