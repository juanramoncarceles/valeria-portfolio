excerpt: "The property is located in the neighbourhood of Vallcarca , and it’s composed by an historical building built in 1900, next to the Vallcarca Viaduct and surrounded by the gardens of the property. The strategy values the architectural features of the existing building and offer a new annexed space that contains all the functional requirements for a social centre house."
body: "The property is located in the neighbourhood of Vallcarca , and it’s composed by an historical building built in 1900, next to the Vallcarca Viaduct and surrounded by the gardens of the property. The strategy values the architectural features of the existing building and offer a new annexed space that contains all the functional requirements for a social centre house. In this sense, a new volume is proposed separated from the old one by a block of services, which also functions as a distributive space. In this way the project responds to the need of a better connection between the two levels of the neighbourhood, since the nucleus provides a direct route between Carrer de Bequer and the Vallcarca Viaduct."
