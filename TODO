Bugs:
    ☐ If a page / post / project doesn't have a translation in a laguage it shouldn't show that language in the select.
      This affects only posts since those are the ones that should be really translated as a file. To fix this in the gatsby-node a resolver for a field called
      translations should be created. The resolver should check how many index md files there are in the same post folder and to which lang correspond.

Features:
    ☐ Make the excerpt automatic from the body text, by a max amount of characters?
    ☐ Create a page to list posts by category. Categories in posts should link to that page.
        https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-tags-and-categories-to-blog-posts/
        Categories should have their slug equivalent to use them in the url.
    ☐ Implement going from one post page to the next/previous post page.

Changes: 
    ☐ Look for an alternative for background images to auto optimize them.
        Use a regular image placed absolute or something like this: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-background-image/
    ☐ Since the best process for dark theme is to pass it to the layout component, maybe it should be handled from above, and in the css files use something like :global(.dark) .whatever


DONE:
    ✔ Multilingual @done(20-12-10 19:52)
    ✔ In the Blog page all posts in all languages are displayed. Instead they should be filtered by the current language. @done(20-12-28 21:12)
        Once this is done, force to always only show the posts in italian (regardless of the lang) since it will start with only italian posts.
    ✔ Post template css styles. @done(21-01-04 19:17)
