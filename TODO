Bugs:
    ☐ If a page / post / project doesn't have a translation in a laguage it shouldn't show that language in the select.
    ☐ In the Blog page all posts in all languages are displayed. Instead they should be filtered by the current language.
        Once this is done, force to always only show the posts in italian (regardless of the lang) since it will start with only italian posts.
    ☐ Improve the current dark theme. For example when enabled in the home some post excerpts are not readable.

Features:
    ☐ Make the excerpt automatic from the body text, by a max amount of characters?

Changes: 
    ☐ Look for an alternative for background images to auto optimize them.
        Use a regular image placed absolute or something like this: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-background-image/


DONE:
