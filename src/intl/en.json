    "description": "Hi! I'm Valeria, an italian architect with 4 years of professional experience. I've had the opportunity to work in different contexts, as I've been living in The Netherlands and in Spain in the last years. That's why I can say I really appreciate open minded people and stimulating environments. As an architect and as a person, I really care about sustainability and leaving my best possible contribution on this planet. I also have a postgraduate diploma in Web design, which I approached lately and I'm gradually mixing to my profession."
